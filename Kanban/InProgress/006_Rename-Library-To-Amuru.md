# Rename Library from TimeWarp.Cli to TimeWarp.Amuru

## Description

Rename the entire library from TimeWarp.Cli to TimeWarp.Amuru to align with the new repository name (timewarp-amuru).

Additionally, the old TimeWarp.Cli package should be unlisted from NuGet to prevent confusion.

## Requirements

- Update Package ID from TimeWarp.Cli to TimeWarp.Amuru
- Update all project file names and references
- Update all documentation references
- Unlist TimeWarp.Cli package from NuGet.org
