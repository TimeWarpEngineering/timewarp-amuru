# Add Long Output Tests

## Description

Define and test behavior with very long command outputs to ensure proper memory handling and performance characteristics. Currently undefined what constitutes "very long" output and how the library behaves under such conditions.

## Requirements

- Define threshold for "very long" output (suggest 10MB+ as starting point)
- Test memory usage patterns with large outputs
- Ensure graceful handling without memory issues
- Validate performance characteristics
- Test both GetStringAsync() and GetLinesAsync() with large data

## Checklist

### Design
- [ ] Define "very long" output threshold (10MB, 100MB, etc.)
- [ ] Design synthetic test commands to generate large outputs
- [ ] Plan memory usage monitoring during tests

### Implementation
- [ ] Create synthetic large output commands (e.g., `seq 1 1000000`)
- [ ] Implement memory usage monitoring tests
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for large outputs
- [ ] Test string vs array handling with large data
- [ ] Verify Cross-platform Functionality
- [ ] Validate Performance Impact

### Documentation
- [ ] Document large output behavior and limits
- [ ] Update performance characteristics documentation

## Notes

This addresses a high-priority edge case identified in the code review. Need to understand how the library behaves with commands that produce very large outputs.

Test strategies:
- Use `seq 1 N` to generate predictable large outputs
- Monitor memory usage during execution
- Test both cached and non-cached scenarios
- Validate garbage collection behavior
