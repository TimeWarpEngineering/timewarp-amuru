# Add Concurrent Execution Tests

## Description

Implement comprehensive tests to validate TimeWarp.Cli's thread safety claims with actual concurrent execution scenarios. The library claims to be thread-safe through immutable design, but this needs validation with real concurrent access patterns.

## Requirements

- Test multiple threads accessing the same CommandResult instance simultaneously
- Test concurrent pipeline operations
- Test caching behavior under concurrent access
- Validate that no race conditions exist
- Ensure performance remains acceptable under concurrent load

## Checklist

### Design
- [x] Identify concurrent execution scenarios to test
- [ ] Design test cases for thread safety validation
- [ ] Plan performance benchmarks for concurrent scenarios

### Implementation
- [ ] Create concurrent execution test class
- [ ] Implement multi-threaded CommandResult access tests
- [ ] Add concurrent pipeline operation tests
- [ ] Add concurrent caching behavior tests
- [ ] Verify Cross-platform Functionality
- [ ] Validate Performance Impact

### Documentation
- [ ] Document concurrent usage patterns
- [ ] Update thread safety documentation with test evidence

## Notes

This addresses a high-priority edge case identified in the code review. The immutable design should provide thread safety, but we need concrete validation through testing.

Key scenarios to test:
- Multiple threads calling GetStringAsync() on same instance
- Concurrent Pipe() operations
- Caching with multiple consumers
- Mixed async operations (GetStringAsync + GetLinesAsync + ExecuteAsync)
