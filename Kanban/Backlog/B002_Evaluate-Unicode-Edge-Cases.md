# Evaluate Unicode/Encoding Edge Cases

## Description

Evaluate potential unicode and encoding issues with command execution across different platforms and shells. Determine if TimeWarp.Cli needs special handling for unicode scenarios or if shell-level handling is sufficient.

## Requirements

- Research unicode handling across platforms (Windows PowerShell, Linux bash, macOS zsh)
- Identify any encoding issues that could affect the library
- Determine if additional unicode support is needed
- Document findings and recommendations

## Notes

This is a low-priority edge case with limited expected value. The shell typically handles encoding, and TimeWarp.Cli passes through what the shell provides.

Research questions:
- Are there specific unicode scenarios that break across platforms?
- Does the library need special encoding handling?
- What encoding issues might users encounter?
- Should this be documented as a user responsibility?

Only move to implementation if specific unicode issues are discovered that the library should address.
