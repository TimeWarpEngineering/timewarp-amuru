# Research Binary Data Handling

## Description

Investigate how TimeWarp.Cli behaves when commands produce binary output (images, executables, compressed files, etc.). Determine if binary data is handled gracefully or if it causes corruption or unexpected behavior.

## Requirements

- Understand current binary data handling behavior
- Determine if binary output corrupts or passes through correctly
- Evaluate if binary data handling is a valid use case for scripting scenarios
- Document any limitations or recommendations

## Notes

This is a medium-priority edge case that needs research before implementation. Questions to answer:

- What happens with `cat image.png` or similar binary commands?
- Does the library corrupt binary data during string conversion?
- Is binary data handling a realistic use case for shell scripting scenarios?
- Should we support binary data or document it as unsupported?

Research phase should determine if this warrants actual implementation work or if it should be documented as outside the library's scope.
